This is an actual README for the redistricting redux project.

(Update 3/3: To run this from the command line, type `poetry shell` to instantiate a poetry shell, then type `poetry run python redistricting_redux`. That will call `__main__.py`, which in turn calls `app.py`. 

As of now, you CANNOT use `python3 -m...`; it WILL NOT work.
